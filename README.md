# ReviewSense - Front End Repository
This repository hosts the front end Angular application for ReviewSense.

### Abstract
In this senior project, we were tasked with developing a web-based solution that incorporates machine learning on a set of movie reviews to organize them by sentiment. The stakeholders of our project expressed frustrations with the lack of overall analytics for movie reviews provided by existing services. Our team examined the different potential models and decided to use a Na√Øve Bayes model for our approach. We gathered our data from two Kaggle datasets, one containing labelled data used to train our model, and the other containing unlabelled data to apply labels to using our trained model. Additionally, we established a back-end server with Python Flask to communicate to our SQLite database and send data using HTTP endpoints. This data is then displayed on a front-end website, built with the Angular framework. We present the resulting website as a minimum viable solution to our stakeholder's concerns.

### Requirements
Our application was built with the following high-level requirements in mind:
* Build and train a custom non-library dependant algorithm to sentimentalize movie reviews.
* Display the overall sentiment breakdown of a movie.
* Let the users search for a particular movie they are interested in.
* Show popular words used in the reviews of a movie.
* Display all the reviews for that particular movie for the user to read.

### Constraints
Our application was built under the following constraints:
* The project must be completed within 32 weeks.
* The machine learning algorithm must be implemented without the use of external libraries.
* The project must be hosted online.
* Due to inaccessability of review APIs, the project utilizes two Kaggle datasets for the sentiment analysis.

## Demonstration & Features

### Home Page
Here, we display our top hightly reviewed movies carousel-style (utilizing the [Owl Carousel Library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ngx-owl-carousel-o/v/0.0.4#get-started)). Users can click on any of the movies here to bring them to the respective movie details page:

### Search Results
Users may enter a search term to filter through our database of movies. The results are displayed in a list:

### Movie Details Page
This page provides an overview of the results of our sentiment analysis, including a list of reviews associated with that movie:

Users may click on the pie chart slices to filter the list of reviews by positivity (utilizing [Apache ECharts](https://echarts.apache.org/en/index.html)):

Users may also click on a word in the word cloud to filter the list of reviews by those containing the chosen word (utilizing [angular-d3-cloud](https://openbase.com/js/angular-d3-cloud)):

### Review Details Page
This page provides an overview for a specific review, including the positivity score given by our ML algorithm:

## Software Stack
Below is the software structure we devised to build this project:

The flow begins from the bottom and moves upwards:
* First, we selected two datasets from Kaggle, one containing reviews with positivity labels to train our AI model, and another containing thousands of unlabelled reviews to apply our model to.
* After some data preprocessing, we trained our AI model and applied it to the unlabelled data. The database now contains thousands of reviews categorized with a sentiment score.
* A Python Flask server serves as a RESTful API for the Angular framework to communicate with the database over HTTP.
