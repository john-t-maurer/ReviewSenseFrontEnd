# MovieReviewFrontEnd

In this senior project, we are tasked with developing a web-based solution that incorporates machine learning on a set of movie reviews to organize them by sentiment. The stakeholders of our project expressed frustrations with the lack of overall analytics for movie reviews provided by existing services. Our team examined the different potential models and decided to use a Na√Øve Bayes model for our approach. We gathered our data from two Kaggle datasets, one containing labelled data used to train our model, and the other containing unlabelled data to apply labels to using our trained model. Additionally, we established a back-end server with Python Flask to communicate to our SQLite database and send data using HTTP endpoints. This data is then displayed on a front-end website, built with the Angular framework. We present the resulting website as a minimum viable solution to our stakeholder's concerns.

### Requirements
Our application was built with the following high-level requirements in mind:
* Build and train a custom non-library dependant algorithm to sentimentalize movie reviews.
* Display the overall sentiment breakdown of a movie.
* Let the users search for a particular movie they are interested in.
* Show popular words used in the reviews of a movie.
* Display all the reviews for that particular movie for the user to read.

### Constraints
Our application was built under the following constraints:
* The project must be completed within 32 weeks.
* The machine learning algorithm must be implemented without the use of external libraries.
* The project must be hosted online.
* Due to inaccessability of review APIs, the project utilizes two Kaggle datasets for the sentiment analysis.
