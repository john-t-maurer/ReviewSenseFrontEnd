for ReviewSense.\nAbstract\nIn this senior project, we were tasked with developing a web-based solution that incorporates machine learning on a set of movie reviews to organize them by sentiment. The stakeholders of our project expressed frustrations with the lack of overall analytics for movie reviews provided by existing services. Our team examined the different potential models and decided to use a Naïve Bayes model for our approach. We gathered our data from two Kaggle datasets, one containing labelled data used to train our model, and the other containing unlabelled data to apply labels to using our trained model. Additionally, we established a back-end server with Python Flask to communicate to our SQLite database and send data using HTTP endpoints. This data is then displayed on a front-end website, built with the Angular framework. We present the resulting website as a minimum viable solution to our stakeholder's concerns.\nRequirements\nOur application was built with the following high-level requirements in mind:\n\nBuild and train a custom non-library dependant algorithm to sentimentalize movie reviews.\nDisplay the overall sentiment breakdown of a movie.\nLet the users search for a particular movie they are interested in.\nShow popular words used in the reviews of a movie.\nDisplay all the reviews for that particular movie for the user to read.\n\nConstraints\nOur application was built under the following constraints:\n\nThe project must be completed within 32 weeks.\nThe machine learning algorithm must be implemented without the use of external libraries.\nThe project must be hosted online.\nDue to inaccessability of review APIs, the project utilizes two Kaggle datasets for the sentiment analysis.\n\nDemonstration & Features\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43382258/162596823-d6896c0f-4020-490e-95c8-2a5a590e62dc.mp4\nHome Page\nHere, we display our top hightly reviewed movies carousel-style (utilizing the Owl Carousel Library). Users can click on any of the movies here to bring them to the respective movie details page:\n\nSearch Results\nUsers may enter a search term to filter through our database of movies. The results are displayed in a list:\n\nMovie Details Page\nThis page provides an overview of the results of our sentiment analysis, including a list of reviews associated with that movie:\n\nUsers may click on the pie chart slices to filter the list of reviews by positivity (utilizing Apache ECharts):\n\nUsers may also click on a word in the word cloud to filter the list of reviews by those containing the chosen word (utilizing angular-d3-cloud):\n\nReview Details Page\nThis page provides an overview for a specific review, including the positivity score given by our ML algorithm:\n\nFront End Documentation\nThis documentation was generated by Compodoc.\n[Figure out that crap using that one website]\nBack End Documentation\nYou can find the back end documentation in this repository.\nSoftware Stack\nBelow is the software structure we devised to build this project:\n\nThe flow begins from the bottom and moves upwards:\n\nFirst, we selected two datasets from Kaggle, one containing reviews with positivity labels to train our AI model, and another containing thousands of unlabelled reviews to apply our model to.\nAfter some data preprocessing, we trained our AI model and applied it to the unlabelled data. The database now contains thousands of reviews categorized with a sentiment score.\nA Python Flask server serves as a RESTful API for the Angular framework to communicate with the database over HTTP.\n\nBuilt With\nMain Technologies\n\nAngular -
